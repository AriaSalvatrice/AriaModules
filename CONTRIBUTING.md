Hello, I barely know C++. I don't really know my way around git. Much less around github. I also know nothing about DSP. Also, music theory makes my head hurt. Nice to meet you. I'm your project maintainer. I just sort of do things until my modules happen to work.

Let's get the lawyer stuff out of the way first: **by sending me pull requests, you assign their copyright to me, allowing me, in perpetuity, to license your contributions however I see fit**.    
Right now, that means a mix of GPL-3.0-only and WTFPL, but I reserve the right to relicense it or re-use code in proprietary projects in the future.     
This is a personal project where I don't expect external contributions to be any more complex than small-scale bugfixes and feature additions, so I think that's reasonable. If you think that's unreasonable, don't contribute. You will be asked to acknowledge this policy the first time you send me a pull request. 

Also I'm not big on acting all professional like in a hobby project. IDGAF about American open-source as unpaid internship github punchard bullshit decorum, go to hell if that's your vibe.

Help is more than welcome, and here's what to expect:

- Bug reports are always, always appreciated. Especially if you make it easy for me to reproduce them.
- Feature requests are welcome! 
- Feature requests for things that can be done with a little bit of creative patching are unlikely to be considered. I prefer modules that do one task well, and trust me to actually take advantage of the whole modular thing.
- Pull requests that fix bugs, increase performance, or simplify bad code are very likely to be merged.
- Pull requests that add features without consulting with me will probably not be merged. Adding features means adding complexity for me and users, and requiring me to document and maintain them. 
- Pull requests that do not follow (or elegantly expand upon) my established visual language will not be merged. Please consult with me first, I prefer to do the visual design if you wish to implement something.

This collection of modules is free software. 

If you wish to send me a tip for my modules, at this time, donations can only be accepted in the form of [pay-what-you-want album purchases](https://ariasalvatrice.bandcamp.com/releases). Feel free to send me a message along with the donation: <woof@aria.dog>!

I am looking into providing more convenient donation options in the future, since bandcamp takes their cut and requires you to make a purchase you might not be interested in. It is unfortunately difficult to find a payment processor that operates legally in France but respect the choice of individuals to go by a chosen name. Thank you for your understanding.

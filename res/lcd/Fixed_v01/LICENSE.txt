These SVG files were exported from the Fixed_v01 font by Orgdot,
available from http://www.orgdot.com/aliasfonts/index.htm 

The exporter used was Pixels to Svg https://codepen.io/shshaw/pen/XbxvNj

Various customizations were applied:

- The line-height was lowered to cause a scanline effect.
- The | (pipe) character was moved 1 pixel to the right, to align better
with the piano on the Modulus Salomonis Regis module.
- The _ (underscore) was made 1 pixel less wide.
- The = (equal) character was replaced with a full block.

The font is distributed under a custom license, reproduced verbatim below.

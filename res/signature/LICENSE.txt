If you edit my code to use my modules as a base for your own altered modules,
remove my signature from your faceplates, even if you think your changes
are trivial: I don't want to endorse and take credit for something I
didn't vet or personally participate in. 

If you are faithfully porting my code to a fork of VCV Rack, are compiling
binaries for another platform, or are otherwise faithfully distributing my
modules as I designed them, keep the signature. If unsure, just ask. 

The easiest way to remove my signature from every module is by blanking or
replacing the graphic in the signature.svg file, and removing it from the
blank plate: res/faceplates/Blank.svg.
